<br/>
<h3>Before Starting</h3>
<p>Reading this quick guide is recommended in order to start using SEPAP properly.</p>

<p>To configure your account for the first time there are two possible scenarios. <br />
a) If your teacher/instructor created an account for you:</p>
<ol>
   	<li>Go to the Sign In page.</li>
   	<li>Enter your ID in the following format: 'A00123456'.</li>
   	<li>Enter your password, which should be your ID 'a00123456' (must be in lower case!). </li>
    	<p>Once logged in, it is strongly recommended to change your password to avoid misuse of your account.</p>
	<li>Click on 'Edit Registration' on the upper menu.</li>
	<li>Type in your current password as well as the newly desired password to edit your sign in credentials.</li>
</ol>

<p>b) Or if you do not have an account then head to the Register page.</p>
<p>Now go ahead and browse the problems list!</p>

<h3>Verifying the problem's solution</h3>
<p>Once you have solved a problem, then the next step is using SEPAP's online judge to verify the result.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the corresponding problem's page.</li>
    <li>Select your code's corresponding language from the language select box.</li>
    <li>Choose the file containg your solution's source code.</li>
    <li>Finally click on Create Attempt.</li>
    <li>Once you're done you will see the result on a new 'tab'.</li>
</ol>
<p> Your soultion can have one of the following outcomes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>COMPLETE</b> –Your solution was successful and did match the expected output.</li>
    <li><b>INCOMPLETE</b> – Your solution was compiled successfully but did not match the expected output.</li>
    <li><b>INCOMPLETE due to COMPILATION ERROR</b> – Your solution could not be compiled.</li>
    <li><b>INCOMPLETE due to TIME EXCEEDED</b> – Your solution took too much time during execution meaning it probably has an infinite loop.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reviewing your previous attempts</h3>
<p>To review your attempts you will need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on My attempts on the top menu.</li>
<li>There will be a list containing all the problems you have previously attempted.</li>
<li>Click on any problem you wish to review.</li>
<li>Each tab contains an attempt you have done.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id='tech-detail'>Technical Details</h3>
  <p> While planning a solution for a problem, take the following into account: </p>

  <p> General recommendations </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Do not use banners to “ask“ for input from the user </li>
    <li> Display the results exactly as requested on the problem description </li>
    <li> Compiler used javac version 1.6.0_33 </li>
  </ul>

  <p> For problems written in C/C++ </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Only use libraries supported by the ANSI C standard </li>
    <li> Do not use libraries/functions written specifically for a certain OS/enrivonment. For example 'conio.h' or the System(“pause“) function for Visual Studio </li>
    <li> Make sure to include the headers of every external library used. For example: #include&lt;math.h&gt; </li>
    <li> Compiler used g++ version 4.6.3 </li>
  </ul>

  <p> For problems written in Java </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Only use libraries supported by the javac compiler </li>
    <li> Do not use libraries/functions written specifically for a certain OS/enrivonment. </li>
    <li> Compiler used javac version 1.6.0_33 </li>
  </ul>"
